# Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock
If any of you have watched "THE BIG BANG THEORY", you would know what this game is all about. It's very simple-

As Sheldon explains *"Scissors cuts papers, paper cover rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."*


## The major process involved are:
- Getting our data
- Training our model
- Playing the game

## Requirements:
- tensorflow
- keras
- opencv

I tried to implement the extended version of "rock paper scissors" using opencv and I hope you would like it:)
